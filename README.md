# Sleep-Fit 🛌✨

**Sleep-Fit** is a machine learning project aimed at analyzing and predicting sleep health and lifestyle patterns using a dataset sourced from Kaggle. The project includes data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the development of classification models. The best-performing model, Gradient Boosting Classifier, achieved 90% accuracy and was deployed as a web application.

## Features 🚀
- Data preprocessing and analysis to uncover patterns in sleep health.
- Machine learning model development with **Gradient Boosting Classifier** for prediction.
- Flask-based web application with an HTML/CSS interface.
- Hosted on **Render** for easy access.

## Dataset 📊
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle: [Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset).

## Technology Stack 🛠️
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy
- **EDA and Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn (Gradient Boosting Classifier)
- **Backend:** Flask
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS
- **Deployment:** Render
